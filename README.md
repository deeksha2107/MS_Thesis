# Adversarial Attack Analysis of Phishing Email Detection  System Using Machine Learning and Word Error Correction

This repository contains the complete codebase and dataset analysis for the thesis: *Adversarial Attack Analysis of a Phishing Email Detection System Based on Machine Learning and Word Error Correction*. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, adversarial testing, and evaluation using both real-world and LLM-generated phishing samples.

## Structure
- `Dataset/`: Initial datasets and basic preprocessing
- `Feature_Addition/`: Enhanced datasets with additional features and modeling
- `Model_Development_Testing/`: ML models trained and tested on different feature extractors
- `Attack/`: Adversarial attacks on trained models
- `LLM_Testing/`: Evaluation against phishing emails generated using LLMs
